## What the program does, what does it automate? 
The programs asks a series of questions on what kind of differennt attractions in Paris the user would like to visit. The user can choose between one of three churches, museums, or palaces - and of course, no palace. They can also choose how many tickets they want at the palace so they know how much they will have to pay head of time depending on how many people they bring. They can also choose weather or not to go up the stairs at one of the churches, so they know in advance to make time for the long journey.
